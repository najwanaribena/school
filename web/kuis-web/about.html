        <h1>🏢 About</h1>
        <h2>We are Computer Company that sell Laptop & Computer</h2>
        <p>Our company started when John Paul (Founder of Computer Company/CC) was assembling his own computer in his garage. By this time he realized that building his own computer was a very complicated thing. After that he created this company to sell it. Now our company is trying to sell computers / laptops at relatively low prices. Because we want to help underprivileged people to be able to have digital devices.</p>
        <p>Best regards,<br>Computer Company (CC)</p>
